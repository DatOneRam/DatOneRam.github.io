        <!--step one-->
        <h2>Step One: Have Royal Blood</h2>
        <img src="images/crown.png" width=650 height=550 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText"> In order to be a leader, you're going have had to <i>at least</i> have come from a royal man/woman, but preferably you will be royal in your own way.</p>
        <p class="centerText">Leading people is a big responsibilty, and to do so, you at least need the ethos (credibilty). After all, you can't lead if you're just a peasant commoner, right?</p>
        <p class="centerText">Odysseus is the perfect example. Before the Odyessey even began, he was already the king of Ithaca.</p>
        </br>
       
        <!--step two-->
        <h2>Step Two: Have a Quest</h2>
        <img src="images/map.png" width=650 height=550 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">Leaders don't just lead people, they lead a cause. Whether you are a revolutionary seeking freedom, a vigilante seeking justice, a monk seeking enlightenment,</p>
        <p class="centerText">you need to have some sort of goal or quest. Otherwise, you'll just be aimlessly wasting your time. In the Odyessy, Odyesseus lead</p>
        <p class="centerText">his men to Ithaca in their <i>quest</i> for home.</p>
        </br>
        
        <!--step three-->
        <h2>Step Three: Consult Your Muse Often</h2>
        <img src="images/muse.png" width=700 height=600 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">You as a leader can only go so far if you don't consult your muse. Muses (a being that gives you inspiration) are the source of great ideas in leaders.</p>
        <p class="centerText">The more you consult your muse, the more great ideas you have, the better of a leader you are! Homer, the writer of The Odyssey, began his epic with</p>
        <p class="centerText">an invocation (call) to his muse.</p> 
        </br>
        
        <!--step four-->
        <h2>Step Four: Learn To Be A Merciless Warrior</h2>
        <img src="images/homeImage.png" width=500 height=600 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">Some may feel squeamish at this, but to be a great leader you MUST challenge and kill everything in your path. Again, Odysseus is the perfect example!</p>
        <p class="centerText">After fighting and murdering civilians in a decade long war, he ransacked and killed another people (the Cicones) just because they were there.</p>
        <p class="centerText">His later attacks on a cyclops, suitors, and his own serving maids really put the icing on the cake! This cold-blooding killing is the perfect way for</p>
        <p class="centerText"> you as a leader to assert your dominance, motivate your troops, and also get kleos (glory)!</p>
        </br>
        
        <!--step five-->
        <h2>Step Five: Demand Loyalty</h2>
        <img src="images/denied.png" width=600 height=500 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">A leader is only as good as those he serves, and as such having loyal followers is important. Unloyal followers could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>kill you when you return home so they can be with their new lover</li>
            <li>trash your house</li>
            <li>have affairs with those trashing your house</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="centerText">all of which happens in the Odyssey. Unless you want to be killed, you had better demand loyalty of your followers</p>
        </br>
        
        <!--step six-->
        <h2>Step Six: Fight Monsters</h2>
        <img src="images/cyclopsEye.png" width=600 height=500 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">A leader must overcome monsters. If they don't, then what seperates them from their followers more than the title?</p>
        <p class="centerText"> A monster, in this case, can be any seemingly impossible to overcome hurdle. A bully, tyrant, or cyclops are all examples</p>
        <p class="centerText"> of monsters. You don't necesarily have to kill them, just beat them. Example: In the Odyessey, Odyesseus blinds the cyclops Polyphemus after eating all his cheese</p>
        <p class="centerText"> and invading his house.</p>
        </br>
        
        <!--step seven-->
        <h2>Step Seven: Make Decisions That Benefit Everyone As A Whole</h2>
        <img src="images/serpentShip.png" width=600 height=500 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">Although it may be tough sometimes, a leader must make group oreinted decisions. These decisions benefit the group as a whole, and gloss over the needs of</p>
        <p class="centerText"> the individual. These kinds of decisions benefit the most people, so don't feel bad if it hurts one or two. Odysseus, once again, is a master of</p>
        <p class="centerText"> this. When he discovered he and his men must sail past the fearsome Scylla (who always eats six men, one for each of her heads), he makes the</p>
        <p class="centerText">group oreinted decision to not tell them, lest the men panic and kill them all by not contining rowing past her.</p>
        </br>
        
        <!--step eight-->
        <h2>Step Eight: Reflect Back On What You've Done Often</h2>
        <img src="images/howling.png" width=600 height=500 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">Relection is a key part of any leader's stragem. Looking back on the things you've done allows you to see what worked and what didn't.</p>
        <p class="centerText">Then you can plan out what you'll do next. In the Odyssey, most of the adventures are narrated by Odysseus as he recounts his tale to King Alkinous</p>
        <p class="centerText"> and his company.</p>
        </br>
        
        <!--step nine-->
        <h2>Step Nine: Recieve Guidance</h2>
        <img src="images/guidance.png" width=600 height=500 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">A leader doesn't have to know it all from the start. Everyone needs help from time to time, a little nudge in the right direction.</p>
        <p class="centerText">Guidance can come from anyone, although usually you'll want somone with some credibility (ethos). In the Odyssey, Odysseus recieves guidance in the form of</p>
        <p class="centerText">his fortune from Tiresias.</p>
        </br>
        
        <!--step ten-->
        <h2>Stay Focused</h2>
        <img src="images/rainbow.png" width=600 height=500 alt="Oops! Your computer encountered an error while loading this image. Sorry!" class="center"></img>
        <p class="centerText">Sometimes, things will get rough. Sometimes, things will get hard. Don't worry, everyone has to go through it. It's normal. The important thing is to stay focused and</p>
        <p class="centerText">remember what you are fighting for. Odysseus faced many challenges on his way home. Circe kept him on her island for a year, he got trapped by a Cyclops, and was held captive</p>
        <p class="centerText">on Calypso's island for seven years, and despite all of this, he never gave up. And neither will you.

        <h2>An Examination of Odysseus' Leadership</h2>
        <p class="centerText">Throughout the Odyssey, Odysseus makes several good choices that inevitably were vital to his getting home. One of these said choices is made when he decides not to tell his men about the monster Scylla.</p>
        <p class="centerText">Odysseus had been told about Scylla earlier by the enchantress Circe. According to the Odyssey, she had said, "And no ship's company can claim to have passed her without</p>
        <p class="centerText">loss and grief; she takes, from every ship, one many for every gullet" (Odyssey, Book 12). If Odysseus had told his men about her, they would have panicked and stopped rowing, which would have only killed them all.</p>
        <p class="centerText">Obviously no one benefits if they all die, so Odysseus made the wise decision to not tell them and lose some instead of all. Another wise decision made by Odysseus is when he tells Polyphemus the Cyclops his name is Nohbdy.</p>
        <p class="centerText">Because Polyphemus thought Odysseus' name was Nohbdy, he called out, "Nohbdy's tricked me, Nohbdy's ruined me!" (Odyssey, Book 9) to the other cyclopses while he was being blinded by Odysseus. Had he not had the foresight to give a fake identiy,</p>
        <p class="centerText">the other cyclopses would have understood someone was hurting Polyphemus, and killed Odysseus. Alas, Odysseus also makes plenty of bad decisions. One of these is when he is sailing away from the cyclopses island.</p>
        <p class="centerText">Odysseus cried out as he left, "How do you like the beating that we gave you, you damned cannibal?...Odysseus, raider of cities, took your eye" (Odyssey, Book 9). Because of his hubris (pride), he revealed his real name to Polyphemus.</p>
        <p class="centerText">As it would turn out, Polyphemus was the son of Poseidon. His blinding angered the divine being of the sea, which effectively made the rest of his journey a nightmare. Another example of a bad decision of Odyseeus would be</p>
        <p class="centerText">when he raided the city of Ismaros. After killing the coastal army, his men asked him to let them stay for a couple more days to enjoy the spoils. The part where he went wrong was agreeing.</p>
        <p class-="centerText">Within those couple days, more troops came from inland who were "braver men, skilled at fighting men from chariots, and also, should the need arise, on foot" (Odyssey, Book 9). If he had said no to his men and forced</p<
        <p class="centerText>to keep going, he would have saved seventy lives. Although he does make bad decisions, Odysseus also makes good ones, making him a well-balanced character who suffers repercussions from the bad while also enjoying rewards from the good.</p>
